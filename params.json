{"body":"# Data and API Catalog Schema\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of [Socrata](http://www.socrata)'s proposed modifications to the proposed [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) and [Data Catalog Schema and Protocol](http://spec.datacatalogs.org/).\r\n\r\nOur proposal is heavily based on the work previously done by the W3C on the [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) standard and CKAN's proposed modifications to that standard in the [Data Catalog Schema and Protocol](http://spec.datacatalogs.org/). It also incorporates some of [Data.gov's work on API catalogs](http://wiki.data.gov/wiki/Draft_API_Catalog_metadata_schema).\r\n\r\n## Files of note:\r\n\r\n- specification.mkd - The detailed spec (work currently in progress)\r\n- notes.mkd - Various notes from our learnings \r\n- examples/ - Examples of catalog entries and listings in different formats \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, please do!
