# Data and API Catalog Schema

The beginnings of [Socrata](http://www.socrata)'s proposed modifications to the proposed [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) and [Data Catalog Schema and Protocol](http://spec.datacatalogs.org/).

Our proposal is heavily based on the work previously done by the W3C on the [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) standard and CKAN's proposed modifications to that standard in the [Data Catalog Schema and Protocol](http://spec.datacatalogs.org/). It also incorporates some of [Data.gov's work on API catalogs](http://wiki.data.gov/wiki/Draft_API_Catalog_metadata_schema).

## Files of note:
