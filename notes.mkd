# Possible modifications to different parts of the spec

## Dataset

- We "id" should be a URI to the /datasets/{id} resource catalog entry
- Should we eliminate "name"? It seems redundant with "title"
- Suggestion seemed to be use http://vocab.org/placetime/interval/gregorian/ for "temporal", so that's what we used
- Definately agree with the use of the GeoJSON "geometry" object type
